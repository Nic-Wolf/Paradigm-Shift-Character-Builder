# Paradigm Shift Web Applications


By [Nic Wolf](https://github.com/Nic-Wolf).


## Description

Paradigm Shift is a tabletop RPG I've been developing with a good friend of mine. You can find out more about the game at [RedSkyGames](http://RedSkyGames.net).

We've been wanting to add a lot of neat online tools to help make the gaming experience more streamlined and more fun. You can see all of my current work to that end in this repository.

Here, you'll find a collection of web applications built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (which isn't immediately obvious when I use a term like "web applications"). This is going to look strange to JS vets, as I've never touched jQuery, or any other library for that matter! It's all just straight, bland JavaScript! I'll learn jQuery eventually... but not right now. You may also notice that I use a lot of flat files, rather than separate my code like a sane person. This is mostly done because I'm constantly jumping between design structure and application development. I'm shooting from the hip with all of this, and I'm not likley to separate my files until they're ready for deployment on our main site.

**Character Creator** is a flat HTML file which demonstrates basic implementation and usage of the JavaScript "date" object as a functional on-screen clock.

**More to come...** I will be updating this periodically for the rest of eternity, as I find the free time and desire to do so.
