- Added data structures for races and classes
- refactored arithmetic and logic

KNOWN BUGS: 
- Roll mod doesn't reset with class change, which is fine, but the current setup has all stats resetting.
	ideally, only the class stats reset, and not everything else.
- only DEX and AGI stat buttons work with color change
- btnMinusStat doesn't lower value if greater than 9 ??? fuckshit

*********************************************************
3/30/14:
Everything is finally operational! It's not complete, but the main functionality works without error, so I'm officially calling this release the 1.0 version.

As a note to myself, I'd like to see the stat points maintain their used values, so the classes and races can be evaluated by the players on the fly, but that's apparenly WAAAAY more work than I first thought.

- Fixed bug where roll mod wouldn't update on class change. Now resets like everything else.
- Fixed bug where font color for the stat values weren't updating or changing appropriately.
- Fixed emerging bug where stat minus buttons weren't working after a value was greater than 10
